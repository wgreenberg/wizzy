================
`wizzy` is a rich user-friendly command line tool written in node.js to manage Grafana entities. It can save you hundreds of clicks in a day when editing and managing your Grafana dashboards. It can also be used to store dashboards in a Github repo making Grafana dashboards version controlled.

# Understanding the use case

We want/need to edit and modify dashboards everyday and managing tens and hundreds of dashboard becomes hard for a Grafana user and as well as an administrator. To manage Grafana dashboards on command line makes it easier for the users who prefer keyboard over hundred of clicks. `wizzy` brings you that power to change dashboards on your command line. Together we can make it better and rich in terms of commands it support.

# Flow

1. A user makes a local directory to store dashboards and initialize it with Git version control.

2. Then the user imports and make a copy of the dashboard(s) in the local directory so that changes can be made on these imported dashboards.

3. The user uses `wizzy` cli tool to modify dashboard or dashboards and export it back to Grafana to replace the old one.

4. The user also can push it to a Git repo once he is done making changes to track what changed on a dashboard.

## Dashboard Terminology
- *local dashboard* - a json dashboard file under dashboards directory on local disk
- *remote dashboard* - a dashboard currently live in Grafana

## Remote Commands
These commands operates directly on remote dashboards in Grafana via API, so please use them carefully. Dashboard Context(which is explained next) is not supported by these commands currently as they will interact with Grafana API directly.

## Dashboard Context
A user can set the dashboard context in wizzy by the following command so that the wizzy cli is aware about the local dashboard on which it should operate. This is an optional setting for some commands and mandatory for other commands, which makes wizzy cli more intuitive and user-friendly.
